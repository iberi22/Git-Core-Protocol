    ## Git-Core Protocol Standards
    
    ### Commits
    - Follow Conventional Commits format: type(scope): description
    - Each commit should be atomic (one logical change)
    - Always reference GitHub issues: #<number>
    
    ### Code Quality
    - Prefer readability over cleverness
    - Include error handling
    - Write self-documenting code
    
    ### Documentation
    - Don't create TODO.md, PROGRESS.md, or tracking files
    - Use GitHub Issues for task management
    - Keep inline comments minimal and meaningful
    
    ### Cross-Platform
    - Provide both .sh and .ps1 for scripts
    - Use forward slashes in paths when possible
    - Test on Windows and Unix-like systems
